- add support to "prefer higher" for certain packages ?




next release:
- configuration override/extend
 [20:01] <cptn> --config-add="prtdir /tmp" even
 [20:01] <cptn> --config-set="logfile /tmp/%n.log"
 [20:14] <cptn> prt-get --config-set="prtdir /tmp" \
                        --config-add="prtdir /usr"
 [20:14] <cptn> the 'set' would delete the config file's prtdir settings

Don't bail out if no prt-get.conf is found if the user specified
--config-* options

enum KindOfConfig {ADD, SET}
argparser: user addConfig(string, KindOfConfig);
config: go through additional configuration options; add and/or replace



1.0.0

- sysup
  - allow injecting of new (uninstalled) dependencies
  - allow to prohibit recompilation of packages when a dependency failed
    to be updated in this sysup run

- better reports (installed/failed/not even tried to install)
[ ] message log for prt-get messages ?
[ ] timestamps for the log file 
[ ] --quiet mode; suppress output of pkgmk and pkgadd
[ ] prt-get diff stats: "100 Packages with differences"

---------------------------

later

- parallel download (mt)
- download only
- group support
- Actions/Commands
  - Help per command
- Dynamic command binding
- Make InstallTransaction a real install transaction:
  - rollback pre-install if package building failed
  - needs heavy refactoring to be easier to understand/maintain
- Test mode: global (is duplicated right now)
- remove should be in a transaction as well
  - remove transaction
  - install transaction
  - etc.
  - Transaction handler
- better examples for man page
- reorder message to avoid losing the important bits when installing
    _lots_ of packages; maybe also think about forgeting not so
    important things like packages installed before etc

[ ] prt-get rm and cd
[ ] cache file class, help class
[ ] interrupt handler (ctrl-c) kill pkgmk/pkgadd, delete lock files, say
    "prt-get: action cancelled"; warn when cancel during download ->
    STATE variable, separate download and build.
[ ] lock files for log, cache (lock file class)
[ ] move command name out of execTransaction (would be wrong for e.g.
    sysup)


SHORT TERM
------------

* Answer FAQs

* create a fileExists(), createDir() etc helper class

* questions
  - should the install/update result include the version/release?

* cosmetic
  - move all output messages to prtget.cpp (away from main.cpp)
  - remove "using namespace std" from header file

* test
  - add asserts

* functional
  - check exit messages (strings). always add 'prt-get'
  
* refactor
  - check operations in prtget.cpp for common code
  - make InstallTransaction more modular (download/build/install)

LONG TERM
------------------------------
* remove quickdiff
* move find command into list --filter="..." ???

* symbolic exit codes

* new commands:

* questions:
  - should there be a install/update mixed to mode, to install and update,
    which ever method is needed?
  - namespace prtget ? 
  - remove the path:package1, package2 filter functionality from the
    config file again. This could be done by creating another ports
    directories an creation symlinks there to. Could improve performance
  - might people like ansi colors?

* new features
  - list shadow packages (dup) for arguments 

* - rebuild all ports using dependency information


LONG LONG TERM
--------------
- parallel download for installing/updating multiple packages (at least
  download of 2nd package while building first)
